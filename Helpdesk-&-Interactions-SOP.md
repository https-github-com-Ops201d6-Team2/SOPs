# Implementing CompTIA Troubleshooting Methodology 

When conducting Helpdesk and troubleshooting procedures, prioritize and triage tickets based on the severity of the problem. 
Example of prioritizing is one user having an issue with Microsoft from downloading  malware vs. an entire floor not gaining access to the internet. You want to keep in mind the CIA triad- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Use your best judgement. Always keep in contact with the end user; they are your best source of gathering information. 

## Important things to consider: 
1. Always back-up data before applying any changes to your system.
2. Establish Priorities
3. Document Everything

# Methodology: 
1.	Identifying the Issue
2.	Research knowledge base/Internet, if applicable
3.	Establish a theory to determine the cause
4.	Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
5.	Implement the solution or escalate as necessary
6.	Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
7.	Document findings/lessons learned, actions and outcomes
